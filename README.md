# 👋 Hi there! I am Steffen!

🙋‍♂️ I am 33 years old,  living in the middle of Germany and work full-time for the state authority. In my freetime i code here and there, but lately i got into Data Analysis, which I want to explore more of, like I started doing with the Coursera Certificate for Google Data Analytics. 
There will be some projects I did and some more i want to explore. 

Tools💻 i use for the Data Analysis far:
- MS Excel
- SQL
- Tableau
- Python / R

Soon there will be some more to see here! ✌️
