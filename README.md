# üëã Hi there! I am Steffen!

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I am 33 years old, I am living in the middle of Germany and work full-time for the state. In my freetime i code here and there and want to continue down this path.

## A little bit about where my journey started
I started getting to know code while i was in school and since then i continued to code here and there. Lately I put a bit more focus into coding and I participated in some coding seminars and want to share some of the code here. 
Since coding is a lot of fun for me, i might push this a bit more. Who knows what will happen? 

### Whats next?
While the seminars I participated in were very interesting and compelling, I want to take the code and put some of my twist to it, so it's more than just the code from the seminar and combine the things i learned. I want to make it my own. And this is exactly why i start to share my code and use Github.

Here are some of the projects for now, which you can expect to see in my repos:
1. Webscraping with Pycharm in Python
2. Build a web application in Python with Flask
3. Analyse Data in Python with Pandas and Numpy
4. Create Plots in Python using Matplotlib
5. Data Analysis Porjects in SQL, R and visualizations in Tableau


Soon you can find these projects in my GitHub repos.

Right now i try to commit to code more and learn a lot more. 

Come join the journey with me!
