# 👋 Hi there! I am Steffen!

🙋‍♂️ I am 33 years old,  living in the middle of Germany and work full-time for the state authority. In my freetime i code here and there, but lately i got into Data Analysis, which I want to explore more of. I finished the Coursera Certificate for Google Data Analytics already and want to explore more.

Tools💻 i use for the Data Analysis far:
- MS Excel (also at work and at home)
- SQL
- Tableau
- Python / R

Soon there will be some more to see here! ✌️
